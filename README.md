# Employee-Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on various demographic and employment-related attributes. The dataset used is based on the Adult Income Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
# Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Implementation of ML models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
Model training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation
Achieved up to 83.91% accuracy with MLP Classifier
# Technologies Used
Python
pandas, numpy, matplotlib
scikit-learn (sklearn)
#  Dataset
Adult Income Dataset (UCI Repository)
#  Goal
To build and compare different machine learning models for accurately classifying employee salary categories (<=50K or >50K), aiding data-driven HR and analytics decisions.
